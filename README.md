# 🛡️ Honeypot Project
A lightweight Honeypot system built to detect, log, and analyze malicious activity on a network. This project helps in identifying intrusion attempts and understanding attacker behavior in a controlled environment.

📌 Features
Simulates vulnerable network services (e.g., SSH, HTTP)

Captures and logs attacker IPs, payloads, and behavior

Real-time alert generation (optional)

Supports data visualization for threat analysis

Can run on Raspberry Pi, VPS, or local machines

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python for backend logic

Socket programming for fake service simulation

Logging module for attack logging

iptables (optional) for redirection

Elasticsearch + Kibana (optional) for log analysis and visualization
